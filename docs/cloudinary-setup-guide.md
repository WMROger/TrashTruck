# Cloudinary Setup Guide for TrashTruck

This guide will walk you through setting up Cloudinary for image uploads in your TrashTruck React Native Expo app.

## Prerequisites

- Cloudinary account (free tier available)
- TrashTruck project with Expo and TypeScript
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed

## Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) and sign up
2. Verify your email address
3. Log in to your dashboard

## Step 2: Get Your Credentials

From your Cloudinary dashboard, note down:
- **Cloud name** (visible in the dashboard URL and top of the page)
- **API Key** (from Account Details)
- **API Secret** (from Account Details - keep this secure!)

## Step 3: Set Up Upload Presets (Recommended)

For security and consistency, create upload presets:

1. Go to Settings → Upload → Upload presets
2. Click "Add upload preset"
3. Configure the preset:
   - **Preset name**: `trashtruck_reports` (or similar)
   - **Signing Mode**: Unsigned (for mobile uploads)
   - **Folder**: `trashtruck/reports` (organizes your uploads)
   - **Allowed formats**: jpg, png, webp
   - **Transformation**: Set max dimensions (e.g., 1200x1200)
   - **Quality**: Auto
   - **Format**: Auto (for optimization)

Repeat for different upload types (profiles, announcements, etc.).

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (copy from `env.example`):

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name-here
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=trashtruck_reports

# Your existing Firebase config...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
# ... etc
```

**Important**: 
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The API secret should ideally only be used server-side
- For mobile apps, use unsigned upload presets when possible

## Step 5: Install Required Packages

The packages should already be installed, but verify:

```bash
npm list cloudinary expo-image-picker
```

If not installed:

```bash
npm install cloudinary expo-image-picker
```

## Step 6: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Use the example components to test uploads:
```typescript
import { CloudinaryImagePicker } from './components/ImagePicker';

// In your component
<CloudinaryImagePicker
  onImageSelected={(result) => {
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Image uploaded:', result.url);
    }
  }}
  folder="REPORTS"
/>
```

## Step 7: Integrate into Existing Screens

Replace Firebase Storage uploads with Cloudinary:

### Before (Firebase Storage):
```typescript
// Complex upload logic with error handling for CORS, etc.
const uploadImageToStorage = async (uri: string) => {
  // 50+ lines of complex code...
};
```

### After (Cloudinary):
```typescript
import { cloudinaryService } from './services/cloudinaryService';

const result = await cloudinaryService.uploadImage(imageUri, {
  folder: 'trashtruck/reports'
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Upload successful:', result.url);
}
```

## Folder Structure

Organize your uploads with folders:

```
trashtruck/
├── reports/          # Trash reports
├── profiles/         # User profile pictures
├── announcements/    # Admin announcements
└── feedback/         # User feedback images
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Upload Presets**: Create unsigned presets for mobile uploads
2. **Limit File Types**: Only allow image formats you need
3. **Set Size Limits**: Prevent huge uploads
4. **Folder Organization**: Use consistent folder structures
5. **Environment Variables**: Keep credentials secure
6. **Server-side Operations**: Handle deletions and sensitive operations server-side

## Image Transformations

Cloudinary automatically optimizes images. You can also apply transformations:

```typescript
// Generate thumbnail
const thumbnailUrl = cloudinaryService.generateOptimizedUrl(
  publicId, 
  150, 
  150, 
  'fill'
);

// Generate responsive image
const responsiveUrl = cloudinaryService.generateOptimizedUrl(
  publicId, 
  800, 
  600, 
  'limit'
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid signature" errors**:
   - Check your API credentials
   - Ensure upload preset is set to "unsigned"

2. **Network errors**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Cloudinary service status

3. **Permission errors**:
   - Check camera/photo library permissions in your app
   - Verify iOS/Android permission settings

4. **Large upload failures**:
   - Reduce image quality in ImagePicker options
   - Set size limits in upload presets

### Debug Mode:

Enable debug logging in development:

```typescript
// In your config/cloudinary.ts
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('Cloudinary config:', {
    cloud_name: cloudinaryConfig.cloud_name,
    upload_preset: UPLOAD_PRESET,
  });
}
```

## Migration from Firebase Storage

If migrating from Firebase Storage:

1. **Keep both services temporarily** during transition
2. **Update upload logic** to use Cloudinary service
3. **Migrate existing images** (optional):
   - Download from Firebase Storage
   - Upload to Cloudinary
   - Update database URLs
4. **Remove Firebase Storage** once migration is complete

## Benefits of Cloudinary vs Firebase Storage

✅ **Cloudinary Advantages**:
- No CORS issues in development
- Automatic image optimization
- Built-in transformations
- Reliable CDN
- Simpler upload flow
- Better error handling
- Advanced image management features

📱 **Perfect for Mobile Apps**:
- Optimized for React Native
- Reduced app bundle size
- Faster image loading
- Better user experience

## Cost Considerations

Cloudinary free tier includes:
- 25GB storage
- 25GB monthly bandwidth
- 25,000 transformations per month

For production apps, consider:
- Monitor usage in dashboard
- Set up usage alerts
- Plan for scaling
