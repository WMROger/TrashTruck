# TrashTrack

**TrashTrack** is a smart waste collection information and tracking system developed as a Capstone project for **Danao City**. The system is designed to improve communication and coordination between residents, garbage truck drivers, and administrators involved in waste collection.

TrashTrack provides residents with access to **garbage collection schedules, announcements, and other waste-management information**. It also includes a dedicated driver portal for garbage collection personnel and supports location-based tracking for collection operations.

The project also integrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot** that uses stored documents as a knowledge base and generates responses through the Groq API.

## Project Purpose

TrashTrack aims to make waste collection information easier to access and manage.

The system is intended for:

* **Residents** – view garbage collection schedules, announcements, and relevant information.
* **Garbage Truck Drivers** – access their dedicated portal and support collection tracking.
* **Administrators** – manage schedules, announcements, users, and system information.
* **CENRO personnel** – support and oversee waste collection operations.

## Main Features

* Garbage collection schedules
* Announcements and notifications
* Resident/user portal
* Garbage driver portal
* Administrator management
* Location/GPS-based collection tracking
* RAG AI chatbot
* Firebase Authentication
* Firestore database
* Firebase Cloud Functions
* Groq API integration
* Google and Facebook authentication support
* Android, iOS, and Web support through React Native and Expo

## Technology Stack

* **React Native**
* **Expo**
* **TypeScript / JavaScript**
* **Firebase Authentication**
* **Cloud Firestore**
* **Firebase Cloud Functions**
* **Groq API**
* **LLaMA-based AI model**
* **Expo Router**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Before running the project, install:

* Node.js 18 or later
* npm
* Firebase CLI
* Expo development tools
* Git

You will also need access to:

* A Firebase project
* A Groq API key

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WMROger/TrashTruck.git
cd TrashTruck
```

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

From the root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

Install the Firebase CLI if it is not already installed:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### 4. Configure Firebase

Log in to Firebase:

```bash
firebase login
```

Connect the local project to the appropriate Firebase project:

```bash
firebase use --add
```

The repository already contains:

```text
firebase.json
firestore.rules
firestore.indexes.json
```

Firebase application configuration is handled through:

```text
config/firebase.ts
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

Add the Firebase configuration values for the project:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

Get these values from:

**Firebase Console → Project Settings → General → Your Apps**

> **Important:** Never commit the `.env` file or private API keys to GitHub.

### 6. Configure the Groq API

Generate a Groq API key from the Groq Console.

Configure the key for Firebase Cloud Functions:

```bash
firebase functions:config:set groq.key="your_groq_api_key"
```

The Groq API key should remain on the backend and should not be exposed directly in the React Native application.

### 7. Install Cloud Function Dependencies

```bash
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```

### 8. Deploy Firebase Functions

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

If Firestore rules and indexes also need to be deployed:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore
```

### 9. Configure Authentication

In the Firebase Console:

1. Open **Authentication**.
2. Go to **Sign-in method**.
3. Enable **Email/Password**.
4. Configure **Google** or **Facebook** authentication if required.

Additional setup documentation can be found inside the `docs/` folder.

### 10. Run the Application

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Run a specific platform with:

```bash
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
```

The project can also be opened through the Expo development environment after starting the server.

## AI Chatbot Architecture

The RAG chatbot follows this general flow:

```text
User Question
     ↓
React Native Application
     ↓
Firebase Cloud Function
     ↓
Retrieve Relevant Documents from Firestore
     ↓
Groq API / LLaMA Model
     ↓
Generated Response
     ↓
TrashTrack Chat Interface
```

The retrieval process uses information stored in the TrashTrack knowledge base to provide responses relevant to the system and its users.

## Security

Sensitive information such as API keys and private credentials must **never be committed to the repository**.

Developers should:

* Store environment-specific values in `.env`.
* Keep private API keys on the backend.
* Require Firebase Authentication for protected data.
* Apply appropriate Firestore security rules.
* Restrict administrator and driver functionality based on user roles.
